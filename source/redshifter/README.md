### Description

Redshift's manual temperature control leaves a lot to be desired. Redshift_er_ is a simple wrapper aiming to bridge the gap between Redshift and users who prefer to manually control the temperature, by providing simple command-line wrapper with which you can easily assign keyboard shortcuts.

As a bonus, the last used temperature is restored when you log back in, to avoid blasting you with enough light to make even our _sun_ cover its eyes! Features like this make this wrapper ideal for hangovers and headaches.

### Requirements

Written for Linux.

Depends:

* Perl (>= 5.22)
* redshift

### Files

The installer provides the following:

* '/usr/local/bin/redshifter'
* '/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/redshifter'
* '/usr/share/man/man1/redshifter.1.gz'

### Contributions

The best way to help is to let me know of any bugs or oversights.

If you wish to contribute any code, try to keep to the existing programming style. Avoid reaching outside of the language whenever possible or reasonable, and keep things consistent and presentable. If you're contributing a new file, such as a helper or wrapper, try to stick to similar dependencies (where reasonable) and please keep the style of the output the same.

If submitting any documentation, try to ensure the English is correct and presentable.
