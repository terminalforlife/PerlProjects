### Description

Providing plenty of filtering features to help you narrow down your search results, LSPKG is a flexible and lightweight tool to list packages installed in a Debian- and Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux.

If needed, there's also a flag available to allow you to utilize a different '/var/lib/dpkg/status' file for parsing, so that you can use LSPKG on a different system or even distribution.

### Requirements

Written for Linux.

Depends:

* Perl (>= 5.22)

### Files

The installer provides the following:

* '/usr/local/bin/lspkg'
* '/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/lspkg'
* '/usr/share/man/man1/lspkg.1.gz'

### Contributions

The best way to help is to let me know of any bugs or oversights.

If you wish to contribute any code, try to keep to the existing programming style. Avoid reaching outside of the language whenever possible or reasonable, and keep things consistent and presentable. If you're contributing a new file, such as a helper or wrapper, try to stick to similar dependencies (where reasonable) and please keep the style of the output the same.

If submitting any documentation, try to ensure the English is correct and presentable.
