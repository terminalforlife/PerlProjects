# Bug/Issue Reporting

If you have any issues or bugs, I strongly recommend reporting it here on GitHub, as it will surely get my attention. Failing that, since we're not all obsessed with GitHub, send me an E-Mail over at _terminalforlife@yahoo.com_ (rarely checked, if I'm honest). Lastly, I'm _Terminalforlife_ (formerly _Learn Linux_) over at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Terminalforlife), so feel free to leave a comment over there; I always try to read them _all_.

Be sure to provide as much information as possible, if you're reporting a bug, such as program output, error messages, system information, etc.

Thanks!
